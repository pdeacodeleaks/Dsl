1.	average Function:
•	Takes a list listofmarks as input.
•	Calculates the total and average marks of students excluding the marks set as -999.
•	Prints the total marks and the average marks with two decimal places.
2.	Maximum Function:
•	Takes a list listofmarks as input.
•	Finds and returns the highest mark in the list excluding marks set as -999.
3.	Minimum Function:
•	Takes a list listofmarks as input.
•	Finds and returns the lowest mark in the list excluding marks set as -999.
4.	absentcount Function:
•	Takes a list listofmarks as input.
•	Counts and returns the number of students marked as absent (marks set as -999).
5.	maxFrequency Function:
•	Takes a list listofmarks as input.
•	Prints the frequency of each mark in the list.
•	Finds and returns the mark with the highest frequency and the corresponding frequency.
6.	Input of Marks for Students:
•	Takes the total number of students as input.
•	Reads marks for each student and appends them to the marksinFDS list.
7.	Menu-Driven Program:
•	Presents a menu with options:
•	1. Total and Average Marks of the Class:
•	Calls the average function.
•	2. Highest and Lowest Marks in the Class:
•	Calls the Maximum and Minimum functions.
•	3. Number of Students Absent for the Test:
•	Calls the absentcount function.
•	4. Marks with Highest Frequency:
•	Calls the maxFrequency function.
•	5. Exit:
•	Exits the program.
8.	Loop to Continue or Exit:
•	The program runs in a loop based on the user's choice.
•	After executing the selected option, the user is prompted to continue or exit the program.
This program allows the user to perform various operations on a list of student marks, providing statistics such as average, highest and lowest marks, number of absent students, and marks with the highest frequency.

Algorithm:
1. Define functions for different operations:
   - average(listofmarks): Calculate the total and average marks for the class.
   - Maximum(listofmarks): Find the highest score in the class.
   - Minimum(listofmarks): Find the lowest score in the class.
   - absentcount(listofmarks): Count the number of students absent for the test.
   - maxFrequency(listofmarks): Find the marks with the highest frequency and display the frequency distribution.

2. Initialize an empty list marksinFDS to store the marks of students.

3. Take user input for the total number of students and their marks.

4. Use a while loop with a menu-driven interface to allow the user to choose between different operations or exit the program.
