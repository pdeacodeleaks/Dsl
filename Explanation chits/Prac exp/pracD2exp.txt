1.	Stack Implementation:
•	The code defines a stack with a fixed size using an array stack and a variable top to keep track of the top element in the stack.
•	Functions stackFull and stackEmpty check whether the stack is full or empty, respectively.
•	Functions push and pop perform the standard push and pop operations on the stack.
2.	Delimiter Analyzer Function (analyser):
•	The function takes three parameters: a string s1 representing the code snippet, and two strings open and close representing the opening and closing delimiters.
•	It uses a stack to check if the delimiters in the code snippet are balanced.
•	It iterates through each character in the code snippet, and when an opening delimiter is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack.
•	When a closing delimiter is encountered, it checks whether the corresponding opening delimiter is at the top of the stack. If not, it indicates a syntax error.
•	The function returns 1 if there is a syntax error or 0 if the delimiters are balanced.
3.	main Function:
•	Initializes a string s1 with a code snippet.
•	Defines strings open and close representing opening and closing delimiters.
•	Calls the analyser function to check whether the delimiters are balanced or not.
•	Displays the original code and prints whether the delimiters are balanced or if there is a syntax error.
4.	Example Code:
•	The example code snippet in s1 is a C++ code with nested if-else statements and arithmetic expressions.
5.	Testing with Different Delimiters:
•	The code is tested with both {, }, (, ), [, ] as delimiters, and {{, }}, ((, )), [[, ]] as an example of mismatched delimiters.
6.	Note:
•	The code checks for balanced delimiters by using a stack, ensuring that each opening delimiter has a corresponding closing delimiter.

Algorithm:
1. *Include necessary libraries and define constant SIZE for the stack.*

2. **Declare a global integer array stack to simulate a stack and initialize top to -1.**

3. **Define functions to check if the stack is full (stackFull) or empty (stackEmpty).**

4. **Define functions push and pop for stack operations.**

5. **Define a function analyser to check the balance of delimiters in the given code snippet.**

6. **Define the main function to create a sample code snippet and call the analyser function.**
