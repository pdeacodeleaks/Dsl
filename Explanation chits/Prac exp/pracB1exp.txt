1.	Initialization:
•	The program initializes an empty list called list_att with some initial values.
2.	Add Attendee Function:
•	Allows the user to input a roll number and appends it to the list.
3.	Display Function:
•	Prints the current list of attendees.
4.	Linear Search Function:
•	Searches for a roll number in the list using linear search.
5.	Sentinel Search Function:
•	Searches for a roll number in the list using sentinel search.
6.	Menu Function:
•	Displays a menu with different options.
7.	Main Loop:
•	Runs an infinite loop where the user can choose options from the menu.
•	Options include adding an attendee, displaying the list, performing linear or sentinel search, direct search, or exiting the program.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty list list_att to store attendance rolls.

2. Define functions for adding an attendee (addAttendy), displaying the attendance list (display), Linear Search (LinearSearch), Sentinel Search (sentinel), and a menu function (menu).

3. Enter an infinite loop (while(1)) to continuously display the menu and process user input.

4. Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding action:

   a. If the choice is 1, add an attendee to the list.

   b. If the choice is 2, display the current list of attendees.

   c. If the choice is 3, perform a Linear Search on the attendance list.

   d. If the choice is 4, perform a Sentinel Search on the attendance list.

   e. If the choice is 5, perform a Direct Search on the attendance list.

   f. If the choice is 0, exit the program.
