#Chit 1: In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B Students play badminton and group C students play football. Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
#List of students who play both cricket and badminton
#List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
#Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
#Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
#(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)
